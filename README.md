# Welcome to happy-dev

This application is for tracking the productivity and happiness levels of developers on a daily basis!!!

## Possible features:

**Productivity Focused**

- Daily to-do list
  - Metrics relating to how many of your daily tasks are completed (percentage completed per day, percentage completed per week, how many carry-over of tasks from one day to the next)
  - Categorized by personal, project, and "severity"

- Time Tracker 
  - Track time spent on certain tasks (on to-do list), developer can "check in" and "check out" of tasks to see how much time a developer spends on a task
  - Metrics relating to how much time is spent on what category/type of task
  - Metrics relating to how much time is spent on work-related vs personal tasks during the day

_Question: Does time spent on a task relate to how often things are being "checked off" of a to-do list?_
